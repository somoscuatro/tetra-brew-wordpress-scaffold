# WordPress Project Scaffold

This tool provides a streamlined and opinionated approach to kickstart a local
development environment for your WordPress project. It's designed to save you
time and effort, allowing you to focus on building your WordPress site right
away.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and
configured on your system:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): For container
  management. We recommend using [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) for a faster
  and more efficient alternative.
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert): For creating locally trusted
  SSL certificates.

Also ensure that your `/etc/hosts` file includes the entry `127.0.0.1
your-project.test`. Alternatively, you can automate this process using a tool
like [Dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html).
